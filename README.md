News Technical Assessment
---

Hello

This repository contains two pieces of software which will be used as the basis for your interview technical assessment when applying to join a BBC team.

They make up a mock elections system which could show results pages similar to how BBC News covers elections, e.g. 

The two parts:

1) A user interface application for elections results
2) An API service which provides elections data

Your interview will be based around ONE of these two applications, and not both, so please select the one with which you are most comfortable and that gives you the best opportunity to show your ability. 

Before the interview we do NOT ask you to do any work on either application. However we would like you to select one, and familiarise yourself with it briefly. We  would like you to spend an absolute maximum of 20 minutes on this.

In the interview we will ask you the following:

1) How does the software work?
2) Are there any changes/improvements that you would suggest and/or want to tackle
3) Our elections product team have asked for some new features to be added! With the help of a pair, you will be asked to try to implement one or more of those features
