# Mock Election UI

This repository contains a fake 'in progress' elections UI.

Before your election we would like you to get a 'local' environment set up to run this application.

Installation
---

Requires: Node (14)

```javascript
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Note: You will see some console warnings when running the 'build' and 'start' step. Assuming the application starts up correctly these can be ignored.

At this point we don't ask you to do any more until your booked assessment time.

In the assessment we will ask you to screenshare your working environment and talk through the following with us:

1) What does this system do? What are its key features?
2) New Feature requests! - The election product team have some feature requests that we would like you to take a look at. We will provide these to you at the time.
